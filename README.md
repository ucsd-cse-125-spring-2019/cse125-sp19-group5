# cse125-sp19-group5

## Dependencies

This project relies on four dependencies:

* inih
  * A header-only config file handle (https://github.com/jtilly/inih)
* spdlog
  * A fast thread-safe logging library (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
* rpclib
  * A simple c++ RPC library (http://rpclib.net/)
* picosha2
  * The PicoSHA2 SHA-256 hash generator (https://github.com/okdshin/PicoSHA2)

## Preparing the starter code for your environment

You must use the same compiler to build the rpc library as you use
for the rest of your project, otherwise you will get a series of errors.
Thus to start working on the project, you need to re-build the rpc
library.

To rebuild the library, do the following:

1. cd dependencies/src
1. tar -xzf cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
1. tar -xzf rpclib.tar.gz
1. cd rpclib
1. mkdir build
1. cd build
1. ../../cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64/bin/cmake ..
1. ../../cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64/bin/cmake --build .
  * (note the dot after --build)
1. cp librpc.a ../../../lib/
